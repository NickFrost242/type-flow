# TypeFlow - Typing Speed Test

A proof-of-concept typing speed test application built with React and TypeScript. This project was created as a learning exercise to explore TypeScript development with the assistance of AI tools.

## About This Project

This is a **proof-of-concept (POC)** project that served as a hands-on learning experience for:
- **TypeScript development** - Exploring type safety, interfaces, and modern JavaScript features
- **React with TypeScript** - Building functional components with hooks and proper typing
- **AI-assisted development** - Leveraging AI tools to accelerate the learning and development process

The project demonstrates various TypeScript concepts including:
- Interface definitions and type safety
- React hooks with proper typing
- Component architecture with TypeScript
- Real-time state management
- Event handling with typed callbacks

## Live Demo

Try out the typing test application: **[TypeFlow Live Demo](https://nickfrost242.github.io/type-flow/)**

## Features

- **Continuous Word Stream**: Type through a never-ending stream of random English words
- **Real-time WPM Calculation**: See your typing speed update as you type
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Monitor your typing accuracy percentage
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Results Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of your performance
- **Performance Ratings**: Get feedback on your typing level

## How to Use

1. **Start the Test**: Click "Start Typing Test" to begin
2. **Type the Words**: Type each word as it appears, pressing space after each word
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch your WPM, accuracy, and time in real-time
4. **Complete the Test**: Press ESC, Enter, or click "Complete Test" when finished
5. **Review Results**: See your detailed performance metrics

## Performance Metrics

The app tracks several key metrics:

- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Your typing speed
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly typed characters
- **Time Elapsed**: Total time spent typing
- **Words Typed**: Total number of words attempted
- **Correct Words**: Number of words typed correctly
- **Errors**: Number of mistakes made

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** - Modern React with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with gradients and animations
- **Create React App** - Zero-configuration build tool

## Learning Outcomes

This project provided valuable experience with:
- TypeScript syntax and best practices
- React functional components and hooks
- Real-time data processing and state management
- Modern web development workflows
- AI-assisted coding techniques
