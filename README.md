# TypeFlow - Typing Speed Test

A proof-of-concept typing speed test application built with React and TypeScript. This project was created as a learning exercise to explore TypeScript development with the assistance of AI tools.

## About This Project

This is a **proof-of-concept (POC)** project that served as a hands-on learning experience for:
- **TypeScript development** - Exploring type safety, interfaces, and modern JavaScript features
- **React with TypeScript** - Building functional components with hooks and proper typing
- **AI-assisted development** - Leveraging AI tools to accelerate the learning and development process
